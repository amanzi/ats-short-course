Step-by-Step Software Installation and Use
==========================================

Installing the Required Software
---------------------------------

As a first step you need to install the following tools on your system

Docker
^^^^^^

`Download Docker <https://www.docker.com/get-started>`_

**Windows**: If you are not using an Administrator account, you will have to add your user account to the docker-users group as outlined `here <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/faqs/#why-do-i-see-the-docker-desktop-access-denied-error-message-when-i-try-to-start-docker-desktop>`_. 
Note also that WSL 2 is required for the current version of Docker Desktop, thus during installation you may be prompted to update and/or set WSL 2 as your default WSL and follow `steps 4 and 5 <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package>`_.


PodMan
^^^^^^

`Download Podman <https://podman.io/>`_ 

ParaView
^^^^^^^^

`Download Paraview <https://www.paraview.org/download/>`_

Visit
^^^^^

`Download Visit <https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/executables>`_

git (so you can clone this repo)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Mac OSX**: git is included in the *command line tools*, installed via ``xcode-select --install``, or in XCode itself.
* **Linux**: git is included as a standard package under most package managers, e.g. ``sudo apt-get install git``.
* **Windows**: See `Git Downloads <https://github.com/git-guides/install-git>`_. Note that the GitHub Desktop is also an option for Windows users and provides a GUI.
